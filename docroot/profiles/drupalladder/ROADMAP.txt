      Drupal Ladder 1.0 Roadmap: Minimum Viable Product 
============================================================================


  About the Roadmap and 1.0 Development Process
  ----------------------------------------------

    Target date for 1.0 release: August 2012 (before Drupalcon Munich)

    For release 1.0 we're aiming for a solid, stable "minimum viable 
    product" (MVP). The features listed here are all considered critical
    MVP Features.

    If you believe there is a critical MVP feature missing from this workplan
    please propose it in the issue queue here:
    
      http://drupal.org/projects/issues/drupalladder

    To streamline the feature development process, each MVP feature has a 
    maintainer. Maintainers are maintaining their own copy of the project
    (in drupal.org Git sandboxes). After their features have been reviewed
    and tested by the community, these features are merged into the main 
    project's 7.x-1.x branch.


  Versions and timline
  ---------------------

 
    learn v. drupalladder   This project is a fork of the learn project on drupal.org.
                            bryanhirsch tried making drupalladder a sub-profile of 
                     learn using profiler module. Unfortunately, profiler has not kept pace
                     with Drush 5 and the drupal.org distro/make/build process. We just don't
                     have the time to pursue this further for 1.0 Looking ahead beyond 1.0,
                     there would be a lot of benefit to separating the light LMS framework emerging
                     here from the drupalladder.org content and Drupal-specific lessons. Learn
                     (drupal.org/project/learn) seems like the natural place for the LMS-type
                     stuff to live.

                     For anyone interested in pursuing the base profile + sub profile archtecture,
                     the preliminary work done here is available in the git repository, see the 
                     learn project branch called "base-profile" and the drupalladder project branch
                     called "sub-profile".

    7.x-1.0-alphaX    During alpha development, the project is open for new
                      MVP feature suggestions. Post requests in the queue,
                      create proof-of-concept feature branches for new ideas,
                      all ideas are fair game.

                      Lesson content on drupalladder.org will be maintained through
                      updates. Hopefully comments will be maintainable too. But 
                      there are no promises for full version-to-version update paths.
                      Maintain your own production Learn site at your own risk.

                      Projection: Alpha developent will take place March 2012 - June 2012.


    7.x-1.0-betaX     Feature freeze. Fix bugs until we're ready to release a stable 
                      version 1.0. Developers will attempt to provide update paths from 
                      version to version, but maintain a production Learn site at your own
                      risk.

                      Cool ideas for shiny new features that didn't make it in yet are up 
                      for consideration in the 7.x-2.x branch.

                      Projection: Beta developent will take place July 2012.


    7.x-1.0           Projected release dates: 
                        7.x-1.0-rc1, August 1, 2012
                        7.x-1.0-rc2, August 10, 2012
                        7.x-1.0, August 20, 2012
