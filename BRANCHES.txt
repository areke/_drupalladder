7.x-1.x-build

  Never merge in here. Only rebuild new releases from tagged releases of Drupal Ladder.

  The only exception is if you're merging something NOT under the docroot 
  (e.g. custom work inside sites like sites/default/modules, sites/default/themes, 
  sites/default/settings.php, scripts, READMEs, etc.). 


7.x-1.x

  Development branch. Test new builds and work on contrib projects here.

  scripts/drupalladder-dev - This script makes drupalladder a git clone (reset to the tip of 7.x-1.x).

  profiles/drupalladder/drupal-org-dev.make - Rebuild distro with the latest recommended release (rather than explicit version numbers).
